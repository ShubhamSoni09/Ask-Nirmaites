# Ask-Nirmaites

The covid pandemic has brought a gap in communication, especially between the junior and senior students of the colleges. Hence here comes Ask-Nirmaites which is specially curated for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd year students of Nirma University. 

Ask Nirmaites is a full-stack web application, where students can login using email, ask questions or doubts on a particular topic and other users can answer the questions along with edit operations.
